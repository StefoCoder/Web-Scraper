        Dear {user_choice.capitalize()} Team,

        My name is {user_full_name}, and I am a passionate and dedicated tennis player with a UTR of {user_UTR} and I am heavily inspired by your brand.
        I have noticed that many top players trust {user_choice.capitalize()}, and I would love the opportunity to discuss a potential partnership or sponsorship.

        I believe we could form a valuable collaboration. Please let me know if you're open to discussing this further.

        Best regards,  
        {user_full_name}
